		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>This site consists of 3 static views (<a href="/">Home</a>, <a href="/about">About</a>, <a
				href="/htmlDemo">HTML Demo</a>) as well as 5 routes that supply data , including: <a
				href="/students">All Students</a>, <a href="/students?course=3">Students by Course</a>, <a
				href="/student/2">A Single Student By Student Number</a> and <a
				href="/courses">All Courses</a>.</p>

		<h5>HTML 5</h5>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">This site utilizes <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>: a
			markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web
			HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C
			Recommendation" status in October 2014.
			HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
			improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application
			programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.
			For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes
			features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
